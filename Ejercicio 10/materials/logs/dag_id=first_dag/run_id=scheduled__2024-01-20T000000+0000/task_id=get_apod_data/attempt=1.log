Returned value was: [{'date': '2000-06-22', 'explanation': "In our neck of the Galaxy stars are too far apart to be in danger of colliding, but in the dense cores of globular star clusters star collisions may be relatively common. In fact, researchers have evidence that the row of six closely spaced blue stars just below the label in this Hubble Space Telescope image were formed when stars directly collided. Pictured is the central region of NGC 6397, a globular cluster about 6,000 light-years distant, whose stars all formed at about the same time. NGC 6397's massive stars have long since evolved off the main sequence, exhausting their central supplies of nuclear fuel. This should leave the cluster with only old low mass stars; faint red main sequence stars and brighter blue and red giants. However, spectroscopic data show that the indicated stars, descriptively dubbed blue stragglers, are clearly main sequence stars which are too blue and too massive to still be there. Suggestively the stragglers appear to be two and occasionally three times as massive as the lower mass cluster stars otherwise present, supporting evidence for their formation from two and even three star collisions.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/blues_ngc6397_hst_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Blue Stragglers In NGC 6397', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0006/blues_ngc6397_hst.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Neelam and Ajay Talwar', 'date': '2022-10-27', 'explanation': "On October 25th, Sun and New Moon set together as seen from Agra, India.

Mostly based on visibility from a site in Turkey, the 3x4 matrix includes 11 of the 13 total lunar eclipses during that period, and fills out the grid with the partial lunar eclipse of September 2006. Still, as the pictures are at the same scale, they illustrate a noticeable variation in the apparent size of the eclipsed Moon caused by the real change in Earth-Moon distance around the Moon's elliptical orbit. The total phases are also seen to differ in color and darkness. Those effects are due to changes in cloud cover and dust content in the atmosphere reddening and refracting sunlight into Earth's shadow. Of course, the next chance to add a total lunar eclipse to this grid will come at the very end of the decade.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0802/LEMatrixLb_tezel.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Twelve Lunar Eclipses', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0802/LEMatrixLb_tezel800.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Emmanuel Astronomono', 'date': '2023-06-28', 'explanation': "Unlike most entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep sky objects, M24 is not a bright galaxy, star cluster, or nebula.
