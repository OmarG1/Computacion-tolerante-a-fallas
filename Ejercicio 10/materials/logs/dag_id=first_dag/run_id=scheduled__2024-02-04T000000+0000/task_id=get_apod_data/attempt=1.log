It lies about 1400 light-years away, along the northern Milky Way in the royal constellation Cepheus. Near the edge of a large molecular cloud, pockets of cosmic dust in the region block light from background stars or scatter light from the embedded bright star (top) giving parts of the nebula a characteristic blue color. Ultraviolet light from the star is also thought to cause a dim reddish luminescence in the nebular dust. Though stars do form in molecular clouds, this star seems to have only accidentally wandered into the area, as its measured velocity through interstellar space is very different from the cloud\'s velocity.

As the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun, sunset rises up from the ground. Therefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on clouds above.  Under usual circumstances, a pretty sunset might be visible, but unusual noctilucent clouds float so high up they can be seen well after dark.  Pictured above, a network of noctilucent clouds casts a colorful but eerie glow visible above the dark.

An estimated 12 billion (12,000,000,000) light-years away, this appears to be the most distant energetic jet in the known Universe. Astrophysical jets of many sizes seem to be produced in a range of environments where significant accretion, or infalling matter is thought to arrange itself in a disk, from contracting star-forming clouds to supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. Here, as depicted in the illustration, the accretion disk is thought to surround a supermassive black hole, accelerating particles to near the speed of light in two jets at right angles to the disk itself. In the case of this quasar, the jet tilted towards us is visible in x-rays as the particles collide with low energy photons from the cosmic background radiation. The collisions boost the photons to higher x-ray energies and scatter some of them in our direction.', 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/gb1508_xray_illustration.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'The Most Distant X-Ray Jet', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0311/gb1508_xray_illustration90.jpg'}, {'date': '2011-01-25', 'explanation': "What is causing the picturesque ripples of supernova remnant SNR 0509-67.5? The ripples, as well as the greater nebula, were imaged in unprecedented detail by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2006 and again late last year.  The red color was recoded by a Hubble filter that left only the light emitted by energetic hydrogen. The precise reason for the ripples remains unknown, with two considered origin hypotheses relating them to relatively dense portions of either ejected or impacted gas.  The reason for the broader red glowing ring is more clear, with expansion speed and light echos relating it to a classic Type Ia supernova explosion that must have occurred about 400 years earlier. SNR 0509 currently spans about 23 light years and lies about 160,000 light years away toward the constellation of the dolphinfish (Dorado) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The expanding ring carries with it another great mystery, however: why wasn't this supernova seen 400 years ago when light from the initial blast should have passed the Earth?

The rightmost picture, taken by the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope in ultraviolet light, shows that indeed it does.  Pictured, Omega Centauri is the largest known globular cluster of over 200 in our Galaxy, containing well over a million stars.  Many of these stars are evident in the visible light photograph on the left.  When photographed in ultraviolet light, however, different and less numerous stars emerge, as evident on the photograph on the right.   Most of these stars are thought to have evolved past the current stage of our Sun.  These stars no longer fuse hydrogen to helium in their core but rather fuse helium into carbon.  These stars will soon shed their outer envelopes and end up as smoldering carbon embers known as white dwarf stars.', 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0010/omgcen_uit_big.gif', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Globular Cluster Omega Centauri', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0010/omgcen_uit.jpg'}, {'copyright': '\nDamien Cannane\n', 'date': '2021-11-24', 'explanation': "Have you ever seen the Pleiades star cluster? Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as large and clear as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The featured exposure, taken from Florida, USA, covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six of the sister stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer's eyesight.

Twisted magnetic fields arching from the solar surface can trap ionized gas, suspending it in huge looping structures.  These majestic plasma arches are seen as prominences above the solar limb.  In 1999 September, this dramatic and detailed image was recorded by the EIT experiment on board the space-based SOHO observatory in the light emitted by ionized Helium.  It shows hot plasma escaping into space as a fiery prominence breaks free from magnetic confinement a hundred thousand kilometers above the Sun.  These awesome events bear watching as they can affect communications and power systems over 100 million kilometers away on Planet Earth. Recently, our Sun has been unusually quiet.

In fact, among the star forming regions within the Local Group of galaxies, NGC 604 is second in size only to 30 Doradus, also known as the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This space-age color composite of X-ray data (in blue hues) from the Chandra Observatory, and Hubble optical data shows that NGC 604's cavernous bubbles and cavities are filled with a hot, tenuous, X-ray emitting gas. Intriguingly, NGC 604 itself is divided by a wall of relatively cool gas. On the western (right) side of the nebula, measurements indicate that material is likely heated to X-ray temperatures by the energetic winds from a cluster of about 200 young, massive stars. On the eastern side the X-ray filled cavities seem to be older, suggesting supernova explosions from the end of massive star evolution contribute to their formation.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0902/n604comp_chandra.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'NGC 604: X-rays from a Giant Stellar Nursery', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0902/n604comp_chandraC800.jpg'}, {'date': '2011-03-22', 'explanation': "The universe is filled with galaxies.
