Just as rainbows are lit by the Sun, moonbows are lit by the Moon.  Since the Sun is so much brighter than the Moon, sunlit rainbows are much brighter and more commonly seen than moonbows.  The above movie captures not only a moonbow, but several rainbows, moving clouds, and the starry sky visible in 2009 February over Patagonia in Chile. The slight movement of the rainbows is due to the changing sky position of the Sun. Since moonlight is itself reflected sunlight, the colors are nearly the same. Both rainbows and moonbows are created by light being scattered inside small water droplets, typically from a nearby rainfall.  The raindrops each act as miniature prisms, together creating the picturesque spectrum of colors seen.', None), ('M64: The Sleeping Beauty Galaxy', '2004-02-11', 'The Sleeping Beauty galaxy may appear peaceful at first sight but it is actually tossing and turning.  In an unexpected twist, recent observations have shown that the gas in the outer regions of this photogenic spiral is rotating in the opposite direction from all of the stars! Collisions between gas in the inner and outer regions are creating many hot blue stars and pink emission nebula. The above image was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2001 and released last week.  The fascinating internal motions of M64, also cataloged as NGC 4826, are thought to be the result of a collision between a small galaxy and a large galaxy where the resultant mix has not yet settled down.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0402/m64_hst.jpg'), ('Milky Way Motion in 3D from Gaia', '2022-07-06', "Our sky is alive with the streams of stars.  The motions of 26 million Milky Way stars are evident in the featured map constructed from recent data taken by ESA's Gaia satellite. Stars colored blue are moving toward us, while red indicates away. Lines depict the motion of the stars across the sky. The large blue areas on the left and red areas on the map's right give the overall impression that stars in the Milky Way are rotating around the center.

But while the distant world is approximately the size of Jupiter, its close-in orbit makes it much hotter than our solar system's ruling gas giant. Like other detected hot Jupiters, its rotation is tidally locked -- one side always faces its parent star as it orbits once every 2.2 days. Using infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, this planet's temperature variations have been mapped out -- the first map ever made for a planet beyond our solar system. Seen here (brighter colors = higher temperatures), the hottest spot on the planet is not at longitude 0.0, the point exactly facing the parent star. Instead, it's about 30 degrees to the east (right), evidence that fierce, planet circling winds influence the temperature. In the planet-wide map, the temperature measurements vary from about 930 to 650 degrees C (1,700 to 1,200 F).", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0705/hotJmap_spitzer_mediumc720.jpg'), ('Strange Rocks on Mars', '1997-07-29', "The rocks on Mars tell us stories about their past. To decipher these stories, a scientist must become a detective, searching for clues and fitting them with theories. The above photograph of the rocky Martian surface to the northeast of Pathfinder's landing site provides many such clues.  For example, at least three types of rocks are evident, marked with red, white and blue arrows. The red arrows point to smooth rocks, which Pathfinder scientists hypothesize have been eroded by tumbling through ancient channels of water which evaporated long ago.  The blue arrows indicate a different type of rock, ragged ones with sharp edges, hypothesized to have been ejected when nearby craters formed or volcanoes erupted. The white areas are more mysterious, and might be some sort of composite material.  Sojourner was recently diverted to study these white areas to gather more clues so continued detective work can yield better insight into the Martian past.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9707/mars11_pf.jpg'), ('Accretion Disk Binary System', '1999-12-19', 'Our Sun is unusual in that it is alone - most stars occur in multiple or binary systems.  In a binary system, the higher mass star will evolve faster and will eventually become a compact object - either a white dwarf star, a neutron star, or black hole.  When the lower mass star later evolves into an expansion phase, it may be so close to the compact star that its outer atmosphere actually falls onto the compact star.  Such is the case diagrammed above. Here gas from a blue giant star is shown being stripped away into an accretion disk around its compact binary companion.  Gas in the accretion disk swirls around, heats up, and eventually falls onto the compact star.  Extreme conditions frequently occur on the surface of the compact star as gas falls in, many times causing detectable X-rays, gamma-rays, or even cataclysmic novae explosions.  Studying the extreme conditions in these systems tells us about the inner properties of ordinary matter around us.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/accretiondisk_hst.jpg'), ("The Cat's Eye Nebula", '1997-08-02', 'Three thousand light years away, a dying star throws off shells of glowing gas. This image from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals "The Cat\'s Eye Nebula" to be one of the most complex planetary nebulae known. In fact, the features seen in this image are so complex that astronomers suspect the bright central object may actually be a binary star system. The term planetary nebula, used to describe this general class of objects, is misleading. Although these objects may appear round and planet-like in small telescopes, high resolution images reveal them to be stars surrounded by cocoons of gas blown off in the late stages of stellar evolution.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/catseye_hst.jpg'), ('The Iris Nebula in a Field of Dust', '2019-09-12', "These cosmic dust clouds drift some 1,300 light-years away along the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus.

This nebula's dominant blue color is characteristic of the pervasive dust grains reflecting light from a nearby hot, bluish star. But darker, obscuring dust clouds cover most of the nearly 4 degree wide field of view. At the right is the LDN 1147/1158 complex of Lynds Dark Nebulae.

In 1999 September, this dramatic and detailed image was recorded by the EIT experiment on board the space-based SOHO observatory in the light emitted by ionized Helium.  It shows hot plasma escaping into space as a fiery prominence breaks free from magnetic confinement a hundred thousand kilometers above the Sun.

The horizontal line is light from the intensely bright region near the galaxy nucleus.  Emission at two wavelengths characteristic of Oxygen atoms in the gas clouds is visible along this line. Below the line the emission is displaced to the left, indicating motion toward us (blue shift); above the displacement is to the right indicating a receding motion (red shift). Where do the clouds come from? As evidence mounts, the widely accepted explanation for energetic nuclear activity in galaxies is based on material spiraling into a central black hole with over a million times the mass of our sun.
