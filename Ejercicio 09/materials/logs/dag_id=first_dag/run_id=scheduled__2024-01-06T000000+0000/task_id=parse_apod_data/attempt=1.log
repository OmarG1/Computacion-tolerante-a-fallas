A little too faint to see with the unaided eye, Kemble’s Cascade of stars inspires awe when seen with binoculars.  Like the Big Dipper though, Kemble’s Cascade is an asterism, not a constellation. The asterism is visible in the northern sky toward the long-necked constellation of the Giraffe (Camelopardalis). This string of about 20 unrelated stars, each of similar brightness, spans over five times the angular width of the full moon. Stretching diagonally from the upper left to the lower right, Kemble's Cascade was popularized last century by astronomy enthusiast Lucian Kemble.  The bright object near the top left of the image is the relatively compact Jolly Roger open cluster of stars, officially designated as NGC 1502.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2301/KembleCascade_Lease_960.jpg'), ('NGC 1316: After Galaxies Collide', '2015-09-09', "Astronomers turn detectives when trying to figure out the cause of startling sights like NGC 1316.  Their investigation indicates that NGC 1316 is an enormous elliptical galaxy that started, about 100 million years ago, to devour a smaller spiral galaxy neighbor, NGC 1317, just above it. Supporting evidence includes the dark dust lanes characteristic of a spiral galaxy, and faint swirls and shells of stars and gas visible in this wide and deep image. One thing that remains unexplained is the unusually small globular star clusters, seen as faint dots on the image. Most elliptical galaxies have more and brighter globular clusters than NGC 1316.  Yet the observed globulars are too old to have been created by the recent spiral collision.  One hypothesis is that these globulars survive from an even earlier galaxy that was subsumed into NGC 1316. Another surprising attribute of NGC 1316, also known as Fornax A, is its giant lobes of gas that glow brightly in radio waves.

The mysterious book was once bought by an emperor, forgotten on a library shelf, sold for thousands of dollars, and later donated to Yale.  Possibly written in the 15th century, the over 200-page volume is known most recently as the Voynich Manuscript, after its (re-)discoverer in 1912.  Pictured above is an illustration from the book that appears to be somehow related to the Sun. The book labels some patches of the sky with unfamiliar constellations.  The inability of modern historians of astronomy to understand the origins of these constellations is perhaps dwarfed by the inability of modern code-breakers to understand the book\'s text.  Can the eclectic brain trust of APOD readers make any progress? If you think you can provide any insight, instead of sending us email please participate in a fresh  online discussion.

A corresponding stereo image pair, intended for cross-eyed viewing, is also available through this link. Regardless of your preferred technique for stereo viewing, the 3D effect comes from combining pictures of the same scene taken at different angles -- mimicking the slightly different perspective of each eye. Perhaps surprisingly for Earthdwellers, getting two pictures of the Full Moon from different angles only requires a little patience. In this case, photographer Laurent Laveder used pictures taken months apart, one in November 2006 and one in January 2007. He relied on the Moon's continuous libration or wobble as it orbits to produce two shifted images of a Full Moon.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0706/3dfullmoon0611-0701_laveder720.jpg'), ('Shuttle Engine Blast', '1996-01-01', '', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/engine_sts51.gif'), ('Reflection Nebula M78', '2002-02-11', 'An eerie blue glow and ominous columns of dark dust highlight M78, one of the brightest  reflection nebula on the sky. M78 is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of Orion.  The dust not only absorbs light, but also reflects the light of several bright blue stars that formed recently in the nebula.  The same type of scattering that colors the daytime sky further enhances the blue color.  M78 is about five light-years across. M78 appears above only as it was 1600 years ago, however, because that is how long it takes light to go from there to here.  M78 belongs to the larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex that contains the Great Nebula in Orion and the Horsehead Nebula.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0202/m78_aao.jpg'), ('Dust Storm Over Northern Mars', '2003-07-10', "Almost on cue, as Mars nears its closest approach to planet Earth in recorded history, ominous seasonal dust storms are beginning to kick up.

In this example, recorded in mid-May by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft camera, a dust storm the size of a continent sweeps north and east (toward the upper right) across Mars' northern Acidalia Planitia.

Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die.  In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and  M2-9 pictured above, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes.  The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years.  M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale.  In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto.  The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance.

A recent spectacular exception to this, however, is the supersonic jet in the star forming Herbig Haro 47. HH 47 is so close -- and the jets are moving so fast -- that images from the Hubble Space Telescope from 1994 to 2008 have been combined into a time-lapse movie that actually shows a powerful jet expanding.  Visible above, jets of plasma extending over 10,000 times the Earth-Sun distance shoot out from a forming star at speeds in excess of 150 kilometers per second. Studying how these jets evolve gives clues not only to how the star in HH 47 is forming, but how stars like our Sun formed billions of years ago.
