Its history has become a topic of research, but its shape and two-tone structure makes it one of the more unusual hills that the robotic Curiosity rover on Mars has rolled near.  Dubbed Ireson Hill, the mound rises about 5 meters high and spans about 15 meters across.  Ireson Hill is located on the Bagnold Dune field on the slope of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater on Mars. The featured 41-image panorama has been horizontally compressed to include the entire hill. The image was taken on February 2 and released last week. Because Mars is moving behind the Sun as seen from the Earth, NASA will soon stop sending commands to its Martian orbiters and rovers until about August 1.

In fact, in this Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) mosaic the famous rings are almost invisible, seen edge-on cutting across picture center. The most striking contrast in the image is along the terminator or boundary between night and day. To the right (day side) blue-green hues are visible sunlight reflected from Saturn's cloud tops. But on the left (night side) in the absence of sunlight, the lantern-like glow of infrared radiation from the planet's warm interior silhouettes features at Saturn's deeper cloud levels. The infrared glow also shines from the broad shadows of Saturn's rings sweeping across the planet's upper hemisphere.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1205/irsaturn_vims_c80.jpg'), ('Reinvigorated Sun and Prominence', '2010-03-23', "Dramatic prominences can sometimes be seen looming just beyond the edge of the sun.  Such was the case last week as a giant prominence, visible above on the right, highlighted a Sun showing increased activity as it comes off an unusually quiet Solar Minimum.  A changing carpet of hot gas is visible in the chromosphere of the Sun in the above image taken in a very specific color of light emitted by hydrogen. A solar prominence is a cloud of solar gas held just above the surface by the Sun's magnetic field. The Earth would easily fit below the prominence on the right. Although very hot, prominences typically appear dark when viewed against the Sun, since they are slightly cooler than the surface.  A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month, and may erupt in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) expelling hot gas into the Solar System.  The next day, the same prominence looked slightly different.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1003/prominence_friedman.jpg'), ('M51: Cosmic Whirlpool', '2002-07-10', "Follow the handle of the Big Dipper away from the dipper's bowl, until you get to the handle's last bright star. Then, just slide your telescope a little south and west and you'll likely find this stunning pair of interacting galaxies, the 51st entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the original spiral nebula, the large galaxy with well defined spiral structure is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its spiral arms and dust lanes clearly sweep in front of its companion galaxy (left), NGC 5195. The pair are about 37 million light-years distant and officially lie within the boundaries of the small constellation Canes Venatici. While M51 is visible as a faint, fuzzy patch in binoculars, this sharp color picture was made with a 14 inch telescope and combines digital camera exposures totaling 3 hours and 42 minutes.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0207/m51_hallas.jpg'), ('NGC 253: X-Ray Zoom', '2001-06-07', "Astronomers now report that Chandra X-ray Observatory observations of galaxies known to be frantically forming stars show that these galaxies also contain luminous x-ray sources -- thought to be intermediate mass black holes and immense clouds of superheated gas. Take the lovely island universe NGC 253 for example. At distance of a mere 8 million light-years, NGC 253's prodigious starforming activity has been well studied using high-resolution optical images like the one seen here at lower left. Zooming in on this energetic galaxy's central region, Chandra's x-ray detectors reveal hidden details indicated in the inset at right. In the false-color image, x-ray hot gas clouds glow near the core and at least four very powerful x-ray sources lie within 3,000 light-years of the center of the galaxy. Much more luminous than black hole binary star systems in our own galaxy, these extreme x-ray sources may be gravitating toward NGC 253's center. As a result, NGC 253 and other similar starforming galaxies could ultimately develop a single, central, supermassive black hole, transforming their cores into quasars.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0106/n253_xrayopt_c1.jpg'), ('Shadows and Plumes Across Enceladus', '2014-08-04', "Why does Enceladus have ice plumes? The discovery of jets spewing water vapor and ice was detected by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft in 2005.  The origin of the water feeding the jets, however, remained a topic of research.  A leading hypothesis held that the source might originate from a deep underground sea, but another hypothesis indicated that it might just be ice melted off walls of deep rifts by the moon's tidal flexing and heating.  Pictured above, the textured surface of Enceladus is visible in the foreground, while rows of plumes rise from ice fractures in the distance.  These jets are made more visible by the Sun angle and the encroaching shadow of night. Recent study of over a hundred images like this -- of geysers crossing Enceladus' South Pole, together with regional heat maps,  indicate that these plumes likely originate from a hidden sea,  incresaing the chance that this frosty globe might be harboring life.

Looking east, this time exposure was taken shortly after lift off from a marina about 13 miles west of the launch site in Titusville, Florida. It shows the dawn's emerging colors along the horizon, with wafting rocket contrails at the upper right. The bright streak surrounded by the remarkable, elongated, vapor cloud near the center of the image is the actual track of Discovery, arcing toward the horizon and its orbital rendezvous.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1004/STS131_nguyen900.jpg'), ('Infrared Helix', '1997-09-01', "Five hundred light years from Earth, in the constellation Aquarius, a sun-like star is dying. Its last few thousand years have produced the Helix, a well studied and nearby example of a Planetary Nebula - typical of this final phase of stellar evolution. The emission in this Infrared Space Observatory image of the Helix nebula comes mostly from the expanding shells of molecular hydrogen gas. Dust, normally expected in such nebulae, should also radiate strongly at infrared wavelengths but mysteriously seems to be absent here. The culprit may may well be the Helix's central star, a contracting white dwarf. This small but extremely hot star radiates most of its energy at short Ultraviolet wavelengths and is invisible in this infrared mage.  Astronomers suspect that over time, this intense Ultraviolet radiation may have destroyed the dust. The Sun is expected to go through its own Planetary Nebula phase ... in another 5 billion years.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9709/helix_iso.jpg'), ('Help Map The Moon', '1998-09-11', 'You can help map the Moon.

This scientific possibility started when the Hubble Space Telescope observed a huge cluster of galaxies. The gravitational lens effect\xa0of this cluster was seen to magnify and distort a galaxy far in the background. This distorted background galaxy -- so far away it has a redshift of 6.2 -- appears in the featured image as a long red string, while beads on that string are likely to be star clusters.\xa0\xa0 The galaxy cluster lens creates a line of maximum magnification line where superposed background objects may appear magnified many thousands of times. On the intersection between the galaxy line and the maximum magnification line is one "bead" which shows evidence of originating from a single bright star in the early universe -- now named Earendel. Future investigations may include more imaging\xa0by Hubble to see how Earendel\'s brightness varies, and, quite possibly, by the new James Webb Space Telescope when it becomes operational later this year.\xa0 Earendel\'s  great distance exceeds that of any known stable star -- although the star that exploded creating GRB 090423 had a redshift of 8.2.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2204/LensedStar_Hubble_960.jpg')]
