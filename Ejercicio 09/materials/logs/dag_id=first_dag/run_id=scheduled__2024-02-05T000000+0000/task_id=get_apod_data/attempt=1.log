An amazing picture showing the moon at work was taken late last year by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft and is shown above. Enceladus is the dark spot inside the bright flare, right near the center of Saturn's E ring.  Streams of ice and water vapor can be seen pouring off Enceladus into the E ring.  The above bright image of the normally faint E-ring was made possible by aligning Cassini so that Saturn blocked the Sun.   From that perspective, small ring particles reflect incoming sunlight more efficiently. Cassini has now been orbiting Saturn for almost three years, and is scheduled to swoop by the unexpectedly cryovolcanic Enceladus at least several more times.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': "Enceladus Creates Saturn's E Ring", 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini.jpg'}, {'copyright': '\nVic & Jen Winter \n(ICSTARS Astronomy)\n', 'date': '2002-10-30', 'explanation': "Will this year's Leonid meteor shower be as good as last year's?

Inspired by a lifelong fascination with machines, Verne wrote visionary works about "Extraordinary Voyages" including such terrestrial travels as Around the World in 80 Days, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. In 1865 he published the story of three adventurers who undertook a journey From the Earth to the Moon. Verne\'s characters rode a "projectile-vehicle" fired from a huge cannon constructed in Florida, USA. Does that sound vaguely familiar? A century later, the Saturn V rocket and NASA\'s Apollo program finally turned this work of fiction into fact, propelling adventuresome trios on what was perhaps Verne\'s most extraordinary voyage. This stirring floodlit view shows the Apollo 9 space-vehicle atop its Saturn V. Launched from a spaceport in Florida in 1969, the Apollo 9 crew were the first to test all lunar landing hardware in space.', 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/apollo9_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Happy Birthday Jules Verne', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/apollo9.jpg'}, {'copyright': '\nRogelio Bernal Andreo\n(Deep Sky Colors)\n', 'date': '2012-02-12', 'explanation': 'The constellation of Orion holds much more than three stars in a row.

Just below Alnitak, the lowest of the three belt stars, is the Flame Nebula, glowing with excited hydrogen gas and immersed in filaments of dark brown dust.  Below the frame center and just to the right of Alnitak lies the Horsehead Nebula, a  dark indentation of dense dust that has perhaps the most recognized nebular shapes on the sky. On the upper right lies M42, the Orion Nebula, an energetic caldron of tumultuous gas, visible to the unaided eye, that is giving birth to a new open cluster of stars.

Astronomers came a step closer to answering this question recently by making detailed observations of the high-speed wind source with the space-borne Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).  Images like those shown above isolate regions of inflowing gas, shown in red, and outflowing gas, shown in blue.  Particles such as electrons and protons flow out at speeds near 3 million kilometers per hour.  This wind will typically enter one of the Sun's coronal holes before flowing out into the Solar System.  Analysis indicates that the high-speed wind escapes at the edges of large convection cells, drawn in black.

The disks of many spirals are thin and flat, but not solid.  Spiral disks are loose conglomerations of billions of stars and diffuse gas all gravitationally orbiting a galaxy center.  A flat disk is thought to be created by sticky collisions of large gas clouds early in the galaxy's formation.  Warped disks are not uncommon, though, and even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a small warp.  The causes of spiral warps are still being investigated, but some warps are thought to result from interactions or even collisions between galaxies.

This amount of normal matter was expected were our universe to have undergone a particularly explosive early phase of the big bang known as inflation.  The measurements were actually made on the angular scale of 1/10th degree by detecting slight fluctuations of microwave light that occur in cosmic background radiation.  These fluctuations are thought to be caused by sound waves moving through the early universe.
