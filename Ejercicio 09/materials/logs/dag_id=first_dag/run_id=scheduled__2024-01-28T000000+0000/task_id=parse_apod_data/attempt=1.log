Many black holes are surrounded by swirling pools of gas known as accretion disks. These disks can be extremely hot, and much of the orbiting gas will eventually fall through the black hole's event horizon -- where it will never be seen again. The featured animation is an artist's rendering of the curious disk spiraling around the supermassive black hole at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 3147.  Gas at the inner edge of this disk is so close to the black hole that it moves unusually fast -- at 10 percent of the speed of light. Gas this fast shows relativistic beaming, making the side of the disk heading toward us appear significantly brighter than the side moving away.  The animation is based on images of NGC 3147 made recently with the Hubble Space Telescope.

The answer can be guessed by noticing that the bright areas disappear as springtime takes hold in the south of Mars: dry ice.  Dry carbon dioxide ice sublimates directly to gas from its frozen state.  The frosty mountains, named Charitum Montes, have been covered with carbon dioxide ice over the Martian winter.  The serene scene pictured above is not a photograph, but rather a computationally constructed digital illusion resulting from the fusion of two color images from the Mars Orbital Camera and topographic data from the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter.  Both instruments operate from the Mars Global Surveyor robot spacecraft currently orbiting Mars.  The red planet continues to grow larger in terrestrial skies as Earth and Mars move closer to their recent-record closest approach on August 27.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0307/frostymnts_mgs.jpg'), ('The Last Moon Shot\n\nCredit:', '1997-05-04', 'In 1865 Jules Verne predicted the invention of a space capsule that could carry people. In his science fiction story "From the Earth to the Moon", he outlined his vision of a cannon in Florida so powerful that it could shoot a "Projectile-Vehicle" carrying three adventurers to the Moon. Over 100 years later, NASA, guided by  Wernher Von Braun\'s vision, produced the  Saturn V rocket. From a spaceport in Florida, this rocket turned Verne\'s fiction into fact, launching 9 Apollo Lunar missions and allowing 12 astronauts to walk on the Moon. Pictured is the last moon shot, Apollo 17, awaiting a night launch in December of 1972. Spotlights play on the rocket and launch pad while the full Moon looms in the background.  Humans have not walked on the lunar surface since.

It was found at the bottom of the sea aboard an ancient Greek ship.  Its seeming complexity has prompted decades of study, although some of its functions remained unknown.  Recent X-rays of the device have now confirmed the nature of the Antikythera mechanism, and discovered several surprising functions.  The Antikythera mechanism has been discovered to be a mechanical computer of an accuracy thought impossible in 80 BC, when the ship that carried it sank.   Such sophisticated technology was not thought to be developed by humanity for another 1,000 years. Its wheels and gears create a portable orrery of the sky that predicted star and planet locations as well as lunar and solar eclipses. The Antikythera mechanism, shown above, is 33 centimeters high and similar in size to a large book.', 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1101/antikythera_wikipedia.jpg'), ('The First Explorer', '2008-02-01', "Fifty years ago (on January 31, 1958) the First Explorer, was launched into Earth orbit by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. Inaugurating the era of space exploration for the United States, Explorer I was a thirty pound satellite that carried instruments to measure temperatures, and micrometeorite impacts, along with an experiment designed by James A. Van Allen to measure the density of electrons and ions in space. The measurements made by Van Allen's experiment led to an unexpected and startling discovery -- an earth-encircling belt of high energy electrons and ions trapped in the magnetosphere now known as the Van Allen Radiation Belt. Explorer I ceased transmitting on February 28, 1958, but remained in orbit until March of 1970.

At first look, one only sees the microwave glow of gas from our Milky Way Galaxy, coded red, and a spotty pattern of microwaves emitted from the early universe, coded in gray.  The gray cosmic microwave background is light that used to bounce around randomly but came directly to us when the expanding universe became cool enough for nearly transparent atoms to form.  A close inspection of the spots reveals a slightly preferred angular distance between them.  One expects such a pattern to be generated by sound emanating from slightly over-dense regions of the early universe.  Sound waves will take time to generate such a pattern, and the present age of the universe can then be directly extrapolated.  The above universe age is estimated to be accurate to better than 0.2 billion years.

Lights from coastal dwellings and nearby islands are seen in the foreground with brilliant Sirius shining as the brightest star in the heavens, visible in the constellation Canis Major at the upper right. Many enthusiasts who made special trips to view this November's Leonids were rewarded with similar spectacles of the fireball-rich storm. Airborne astronomers too had much to be thankful for as Leonid observations from a specially equiped aircraft flying at 40,000 feet produced bountiful data on the chemical composition of these dust grains from a comet's tail.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0112/leo2001_tezel_c2.jpg'), ('The M7 Open Star Cluster in Scorpius', '2002-05-05', 'M7 is one of the most prominent open clusters of stars on the sky.

These images are part of a time lapse video tracking the nebula's expansion over the last 17 years. About 1500 light-years away, the nebula is still just under a light-year in diameter. GK Per and similar cataclysmic variable stars known as classical novae are understood to be binary systems consisting of a compact white dwarf star and swollen cool giant star in a close orbit. The build up of mass transferred to the surface of the white dwarf from the giant star through an accretion disk eventually triggers a thermonuclear outburst, blasting the stellar material into space without destroying the white dwarf star. With a 2 day orbital period, the GK Per system has produced much smaller outbursts in recent years.", 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1111/gkper_block900c.jpg')]
