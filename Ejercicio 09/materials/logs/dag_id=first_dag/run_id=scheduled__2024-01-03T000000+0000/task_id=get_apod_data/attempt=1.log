It left behind one of the most brilliant nebulae, listed first in Charles Messier's list of nebulous sky objects. Today we know that the center of the nebula houses the remnant of the explosion: a spinning neutron star called a pulsar.  The Crab pulsar is visible in almost every part of the electromagnetic spectrum, and has been a useful astronomical tool. It is still unclear how the the pulsar emits the light that we see.

Recorded during evening twilight on January 17, this view features the bright coma and gorgeous, sweeping tail of Comet McNaught (c/2006 P1) over Lake Horowhenua in Levin, a small town on New Zealand's North Island. Astronomer Noel Munford reports that the five second long digital camera exposure comes close to capturing the visual appearance of the comet in a sky coloured by smoke from distant brush fires in Australia. Discovered last summer by R. H. McNaught (Siding Spring Survey), the comet grew impressively bright in early January and has even been sighted in full daylight. In the coming days Comet McNaught will continue to move south, for now a spectacle in southern skies as it heads for the outer solar system.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/CometMcNaught_munford.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Southern Comet', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0701/CometMcNaught_munford_c505.jpg'}, {'copyright': '\nTill Credner\n', 'date': '1999-12-15', 'explanation': 'On December 1st, experienced observers patroling the night sky with binoculars noticed what seemed to be a new star in the constellation of Aquila (The Eagle). It wasn\'t really a new star though. A comparison with detailed skymaps revealed the amazing truth, there was a known star at that position in the sky ... its brightness had simply increased by about 70,000 times.  The star, now fondly known to variable star observers as Nova V1494 Aquilae, continued to grow brighter for several days, becoming easily visible to the unaided eye before starting to slowly fade away. Its position within the constellation is indicated on this wide-angle picture taken on December 4th, near the time it was brightest. What would cause a star to undergo such a cataclysmic change? This "new star" appears to be a classical nova. Classical novae are thought to be interacting binary star systems in which one of the pair is a dense, hot white dwarf. Material from the companion falls onto the surface of the white dwarf, building up until it triggers a thermonuclear blast. A stunning increase in brightness and an expanding shell of debris result - but the binary system is likely not destroyed! Classical novae are believed to recur as the flow of material resumes and produces another outburst in perhaps hundreds of years time.', 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/naql2_credner_big.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'A Nova In Aquila', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9912/naql2_credner.jpg'}, {'copyright': 'Jean-Charles\nCuillandre', 'date': '2007-11-21', 'explanation': "The spherical coma of Comet Holmes has swollen to a diameter of over 1.4 million kilometers, making the tenuous, dusty cloud even bigger than the Sun. Scattering sunlight, all that dust and gas came from the comet's remarkably active nucleus, whose diameter before the late October outburst was estimated to be a mere 3.4 kilometers. In this sharp image, recorded on November 14 with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, stars are easily visible right through the outer coma, while the nucleus is buried inside the condensed, bright region. The bright region of the coma seems offset from the center, consistent with the idea that a large fragment drifted away from the nucleus and disintegrated, producing the comet's spectacular outburst. Of course, more recent images of Holmes also show the bright star Mirfak (Alpha Persei) shining through as the comet sweeps slowly through the constellation Perseus.", 'hdurl': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0711/Holmes-CFHT_Cuillandre.jpg', 'media_type': 'image', 'service_version': 'v1', 'title': 'Expansive Comet Holmes', 'url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0711/Holmes-CFHT_Cuillandre800.jpg'}, {'date': '2011-05-30', 'explanation': "This is the last thing that the Spirit rover on Mars ever saw.

Visible in the above panorama are numerous rocks and slopes of the surrounding Columbia Hills of Mars.  The strange hill with the light colored top, visible near the top center of the image, has been dubbed von Braun and was a future destination when Spirit got bogged down. A leading hypothesis holds that von Braun is related to martian volcanism. Last week, NASA stopped trying to contact Spirit after numerous attempts.
